The fellow workers are understanding and good to work with.", "Cons": "They dont have any benefits."}, "2": {"Date": " Dec 22, 2015", "Summary": "\"Mcdonalds Employee\"", "Pros": "Good training, treated like family, half of meals,", "Cons": "Long hours, slippery floors, no air condition, poor working enviornment"}, "3": {"Date": " Dec 23, 2015", "Summary": "\"Good money but hell is the price lol\"", "Pros": "Free mealsAlways got hours cause there was always someone calling off", "Cons": "Sometimes wouldn't let me offSometimes over worked me"}, "4": {"Date": " Dec 7, 2015", "Summary": "\"crew member\"", "Pros": "They have good benefit package g for those who would like to go back to school or anything that may come.", "Cons": "I really didn't see downfall for working at mcdonalds"}, "5": {"Date": " Dec 7, 2015", "Summary": "\"MIT\"", "Pros": "Always different. a different challenge every day.", "Cons": "People lik to be in to each others bussiness."}, "6": {"Date": " Dec 7, 2015", "Summary": "\"Good\"", "Pros": "Good work environment.

My management didn't ever train me at anything and expected me to \"watch and learn\". There is a lot of drama, one manager even told me she would talk badly about me behind my back! Customers are almost always rude! I have a problem with my immune system where I would break out in hives and my face would swell, and it got really serious one day, so I called my manager and asked for the day off to go to the E.R., he said NO and that he would have to see me to determine the severity! I mean, absolutely ridiculous. To me, it's worth putting your application elsewhere."}, "8": {"Date": " Dec 23, 2015", "Summary": "\"Manager\"", "Pros": "You get to learn operations of a fast food business, meet new people/costumer service.

We are able to fix the problems but it is stressful on some employees. A bunch of people might call in and being short handed is hard on the rest of crew if there is no replacement."}, "9": {"Date": " Dec 7, 2015", "Summary": "\"busser\"", "Pros": "good burgers and fries -I love them so much and I eat them all the time.", "Cons": "i hate mopping flors. they make me mop floors and sweep and take out trash. it sucks."}}
