There was no interview process, it's like they just let anyone work there. I wasn't told my schedule or pay. They barely trained me and put me right on the register when I went in for my first day. No one ever welcomed me to the job and didn't care to converse with me. The whole environment was very unprofessional. Mostly everyone that worked there was hispanic and I don't speak Spanish so I didn't know what was going on 90% of the time."}, "3": {"Date": " Aug 6, 2017", "Summary": "\"Basoc\"", "Pros": "The company sucks but a job is a job.
