{"0": {"Date": " Oct 25, 2017", "Summary": "\"2017-Changing the Way They do Business\"", "Pros": "POV of someone who works at the mid-mgmt level in the corporate office in Oak Brook. McDonald's the past few years have under gone some major internal changes. Both from restructuring the home office and regional staff to be more effective and efficient when working with the franchisees and restaurant staff. The pace of change here has increase and presents a lot of new challenges, but as a whole everyone is sync'ed to improve the customer experience.", "Cons": "The pace of change is fast with multi-projects and sometimes in an ambiguous environment, this leads to long workdays (10 hrs+). Not enough support staff (day-to-day admin tasks, gathering data or project management duties)."}, "1": {"Date": " Nov 7, 2017", "Summary": "\"Roller Coaster\"", "Pros": "The company taught valuable leadership skills. Tried to enrich those with potential.", "Cons": "Fairly stressful work. Variable schedules made it hard to plan ahead."}, "2": {"Date": " Nov 7, 2017", "Summary": "\"It was a typical fast food job\"", "Pros": "not much there was a pro except for the food", "Cons": "hated almost everything about it"}, "3": {"Date": " Nov 7, 2017", "Summary": "\"not bad\"", "Pros": "free food and drinks, uniform, and plenty of customers", "Cons": "low wage, limited opportunity for growth, and rude customers"}, "4": {"Date": " Oct 24, 2017", "Summary": "\"good place to start\"", "Pros": "good work if you are focused on the job", "Cons": "can be tough if you are not focused on work"}, "5": {"Date": " Nov 7, 2017", "Summary": "\"Great experience but too stressful.\"", "Pros": "The hours, you should always be able to make hours.", "Cons": "Bad management and rude customers who think they can walk all over you."}, "6": {"Date": " Oct 23, 2017", "Summary": "\"Decent first job\"", "Pros": "I feel my co-workers probably made my time working here better. We were all roughly the same age (with the exception of managers and a few kitchen staff) so it was almost like a big family. You get free food on break, and management was willing to work around your schedule and give you almost any days you requested off.", "Cons": "The customers are probably the worst part. Not all of them, but where I worked a lot would forget to order something or request certain specifics on their sandwich, then blame you and demand to speak with a manager. Gets old after a while. Other than that, be specific when you can work with management. I had open availability but only wanted to work 30 hours a week (during summer) and ended up working 38 hours a week on average, with varying shifts from opening to closing. We were also always short staffed so sometimes they would ask if I could stay an extra hour or two, meaning a 9 or 10 hour shift and sometimes with no break."}, "7": {"Date": " Oct 23, 2017", "Summary": "\"Good food. Crew good improve\"", "Pros": "Nice crew. Good food. Good hours. The crew is very friendly and will accommodate to your needs and wants. Very clean.", "Cons": "Managers yell and complain. Not only at the crew but they will walk away from customers talking about how they are wrong."}, "8": {"Date": " Oct 23, 2017", "Summary": "\"Nice people\"", "Pros": "Co-workers were nice, gave free crew meals", "Cons": "Stressful, loud, hard to communicate"}, "9": {"Date": " Oct 24, 2017", "Summary": "\"Overall average place to work.\"", "Pros": "Fast paced place to keep busy while at work. Pros include free food during breaks for all employees during their shifts.", "Cons": "Doing the same thing time and time again may get repetitive to say the least, but that is about it."}}
