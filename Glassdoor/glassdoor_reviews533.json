{"0": {"Date": " Jun 14, 2016", "Summary": "\"Assistant Manager\"", "Pros": "Great Experience. Friendly Atmosphere. Very lovely people and met some lifetime friends. Worked part time for 13 years.", "Cons": "There were no cons at all. Yeah you get a mean customer now and then but the experience overall is very rewarding."}, "1": {"Date": " Jul 20, 2016", "Summary": "\"A Bad Place\"", "Pros": "They give you enough money so they're not breaking labor laws, but not enough to make sure you can feed, clothe and house yourself reliably.", "Cons": "Pretty much everything else. If things are going to change they'll have to start at the bottom, not the top."}, "2": {"Date": " Jul 20, 2016", "Summary": "\"n\\a\"", "Pros": "Amazing people to work with, it's an awesome eniornment to be around. Its not bad at all when you all work as team. Stick together, or it all falls apart.", "Cons": "Some people aren't as hard working as others and don't use they're free times wisely. Others also lack on cleaning anything, whether it has to do with dishes to mopping and sweeping."}, "3": {"Date": " Jul 20, 2016", "Summary": "\"Never Work For Them\"", "Pros": "There is nothing positive to say about this company. But the morning workers at Leeds are great.", "Cons": "They lie about the simplest things. They are sneaking. They took away free meals for all employees. And they only have raises to those who sucked up to them. They over looked the workers that put in time that needed to be in a position and brought in people of the street paying them more and giving them shirts with no experience at all."}, "4": {"Date": " Jun 29, 2016", "Summary": "\"Work politics ruined work everyday\"", "Pros": "Half off food and pretty easy job to handle for a new person and has very flexible hours which is a plus.", "Cons": "Horrible managers and bad about breaks. They do not like it when you progress fast. You get sent home early if it's slow even if they say they won't send you home."}, "5": {"Date": " Jun 30, 2016", "Summary": "\"First job\"", "Pros": "Easy first job to become employed", "Cons": "Low pay demand stress managers suck"}, "6": {"Date": " Jun 30, 2016", "Summary": "\"Cashier\"", "Pros": "Started you out at $10 an hour", "Cons": "Management sucked. Working there was a joke"}, "7": {"Date": " Jun 15, 2016", "Summary": "\"Great place to work!\"", "Pros": "Sensitive to work life balance. Great benefits!", "Cons": "Not really a con but company is undergoing some changes so lots of ambiguity on culture, values"}, "8": {"Date": " Jun 26, 2016", "Summary": "\"Drive Thur Worker\"", "Pros": "Making customers happy, and hearing positive feedback from them.", "Cons": "Getting yell at the manager, staffs, and customers, customers waiting for 20- 30 minutes to order. ( due to rush hour), not more workers/ staff in my unit. AND sometimes hearing/ receiving negative remarks by customers."}, "9": {"Date": " Jun 28, 2016", "Summary": "\"McDonald's\"", "Pros": "McDonald's was my first job, so it's a good place to gain work experience when you have none. At my specific McDonalds, our owner is approving all of the applications for the Archways scholarship, and they let college students come back during breaks. Most of my coworkers are pretty cool and I've met a lot of close friends there. This job has really taught me about hard work.", "Cons": "Can be pretty bureaucratic. They can also screw over your hours sometimes. They asked me in January if I wanted to be a crew trainer, and I've been going to the meetings and training people but they havent said anything about when i'll be taking the classes so I can actually get the raise. I'm sure they're doing this on purpose seeing as I'm going to college soon."}}
