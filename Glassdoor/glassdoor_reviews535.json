{"0": {"Date": " Jun 27, 2016", "Summary": "\"Exactly what you'd expect\"", "Pros": "The hours are flexible. Also, if you want to break into lower level management it is fairly easy. They offer help with college so long as its business management or some related major and I think English classes are offered.", "Cons": "Low pay, long hours, the stress of working in customer service, and it is difficult for some people to get full time hours. Most employees are getting scaled back to part time or getting sent home early."}, "1": {"Date": " Jul 18, 2016", "Summary": "\"Bad\"", "Pros": "Food, break, certain customers, and certain friends", "Cons": "No training, no help with your orders, and mean management."}, "2": {"Date": " Jul 18, 2016", "Summary": "\"Lead Management\"", "Pros": "Good co workers.
