They really do cater to your availability which other places may not necessarily do.", "Cons": "When I was hired I was put straight into a kitchen position. Which honestly was not ideal as I wanted to work in the front. However, apparently that as how my location works. You start in the kitchen and once you nail that down, you can be moved up to a cashier position. When I first started some of the managers at my location wouldn't allow me any independence. There always had to be someone mentoring me. However each manager is different because there were times I was left without a mentor, which I enjoyed. It allowed for me to learn better since I had some pressure to complete orders. Being in the kitchen can be very very stressful especially when huge orders are put in but the other employees are more than willing to help. Overall I would say it's okay but I couldn't imagine working here long term"}, "6": {"Date": " Apr 4, 2017", "Summary": "\"Business Consultant\"", "Pros": "Great People.

This was great at first but they gradually kept piling more duties on me as time went on and I began to question why I was suddenly responsible for the things the 8am workers should be doing since keeping up with the grill orders was overwhelming already (especially at the switch hour from breakfast to lunch)-Everytime I got sick I was talked down to for not coming into work because they couldn't get anyone to cover me since I was the only person willing to work such early hours. (despite them insisting that we should stay home if sick and NOT come to work)At one point I was so sick I ended up in the hospital, this made the managers angry instead of concerned. They demanded I call the store manager even though I was in the emergency department in intense pain and needing to undergo surgery.- Rotten management (No respect or concern for employee health or welfare)- Too many responsibilities for one person (felt like they were singling me out since I was new)- Exposed to extreme heat for long periods of time- Cramped area with too many people often times."}}
