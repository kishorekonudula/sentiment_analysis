Otherwise, it's nice, slow, relaxed, and just the right of customers come it at a given time.You'll be refilling people's coffees, help taking their orders at the kiosks and ring them up at the register, chat with the elder regulars who have interesting stories to tell, clean some tablets, etc.It's physically not a hard job at all.

Cooking, using the register, taking orders out, etc. With this specific position, you can be assigned to any of these when no one else is able to fulfill that role at the moment.Being in charge of other people's roles isn't the issue, it's when other coworkers who don't know you're assigned to that role temporarily that will get mad at you for doing it despite being told to.No one's manning the registers? You'll do that, and it's not a big deal. Someone else doesn't know you're using their register, they get mad for you not being where you should be even if you don't need to be there at the moment.
